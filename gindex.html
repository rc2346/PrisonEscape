<h1>opening</h1>
    <p>You wake up on a bed in a dim, cold prison cell. You have no recollection of how you got here, but you feel sunk and confused, and need to get out of here. 
        <li>get up</li>
    </p>
    
<h1>room</h1>
    <p>
    There is a window on one wall, barred. On another wall, a toilet, and prison bars leading to a hallway. There's a light with some kind of object inside the shield, and a loose stone in the wall. What do you investigate?
        <li>window</li>
        <li>bed</li>
        <li>toilet</li>
        <li>bars</li>
        <li>light</li>
        <li>loose tile</li>
    </p>
    
<h1>if window</h1>
    <p>
    Outside the window, you see children playing in a park not too far away (why did they put a park so close to a prison?? you think to yourself.) They look dirty and hungry. A broom is leaning against the wall. 
        <li>talk to kids</li>
        <li>use nail file</li>
        <li>back to room</li>
    </p>
    
    <h1>if kids</h1>
        <p>
        You ask the children to give you the broom. They will not help you unless you offer them something. 
            <li>give soap</li>
            <li>give food</li>
            <li>back to room</li>
        </p>
    
        <h1>if soap</h1>
            <p>you got the broom!
                <li>back to room</li>
            </p>
    
        <h1>if food</h1>
            <p>you got the broom!
                <li>back to room</li>
            </p>
    
    <h1>if nail file</h1>
        <p>you file the bars away, and attempt to jump out of the window, but you fall and break your legs! YOU LOSE
            <li>back to start</li>
        </p>
    
<h1>if bed</h1>
    <p>
    On the bed, there is a pillow and a blanket.
        <li>look in blanket</li>
        <li>take pillow</li>
        <li>back to room</li>
    </p>
    
    <h1>if blanket</h1>
        <p>
        You found a bottle of pills!
            <li>back to room</li>
    </p>
    
    <h1>if pillow</h1>
        <p> you have the pillow!
            <li>back to room</li>
    </p>
    
<h1>if toilet</h1>
    <p>
    There's a bar of soap on top of the toilet tank, and checking inside the tank you see a nail file. Maybe if you clogged the toilet, you could get it!
        <li>take soap</li>
        <li>use pillow</li>
        <li>back to room</li>
    </p>
    
        <h1>if soap</h1>
            <p>you now have soap!
                <li>back to room</li>
    </p>
    
        <h1>if pillow</h1>
            <p>you clogged the toilet with the pillow, and now you have the nailfile!
                <li>back to room</li>
    </p>

<h1>if bars</h1>
    <p>
        there's a plate of food on the floor in front of the cell door, and a guard dog sitting outside your cell, a key around its neck.
            <li>take food</li>
            <li>call dog</li>
            <li>use key</li>
            <li>back to room</li>
    </p>
    
    <h1>if food</h1>
        <p> you now have a chicken leg!
            <li>back to room</li>
        </p>
    
    <h1>if key</h1>
        <p>oh no! the key didn't work on the lock; try something else!</p>
    
    <h1>if dog</h1>
        <p>the dog looks at you and tilts his head. You'll need to give him something to get the key around his neck.
            <li>give food</li>
            <li>give pills</li>
            <li>reach for key</li>

                <li>Back to Start</li>
            </p>
    
<h1>if light</h1>
    <p> There seems to be a long object in the ceiling tile, if you had a long rod, you could probably knock it out.
        <li>use broom</li>
        <li>back to room</li>
    </p>
    
    <h1>if broom</h1>

    <h1>if crowbar</h1>

            <li>the pill bottle</li>
